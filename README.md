## Title: Voodoo Casting Bar
## Script - Addon
## Game: World of Worcraft

Voodoo Casting Bar (VCB) is an add on that enchants the default casting bar. You can open the options panel in three ways.

1.	With the commands: /vcb and /voodoocastingbar
2.	Through the game menu. Game Menu (Esc) --> Options --> AddOns
3.	Through the minimap buttons that Blizzard gave us. It’s a tiny number at the top-left or bottom-left of the minimap, click it and you will find it.

Right now, VCB adds:

- The Spell Icon on the left or on the right or both sides of the player casting bar!
- The Current Casting Time of the spell, alone!
- The Current Casting Time and the Total Casting Time together, like 3.45/10.15!
- Those timers can be ascending or descending!
- The Total Casting Time of the spell, alone!
- The Name of the Spell becomes movable!
- The Latency of the casting spell with a red bar!
- The Ticks of a channeled spell!
- All those features are movable, and you can choose which will be visible!
- Color the player's casting bar! You can choose to color the casting bar according to your Class's Color, or according to the Spell's School!
- The Target’s Casting Bar becomes movable and scalable!
